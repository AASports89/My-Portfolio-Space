# My-Portfolio-Space

## An application comprised of an overview containing personal and professional credentials.

### Brief Description:

This portfolio of work showcases my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. As a result of developing and coding this portfolio, my strongest work will be highlighted along with my taste in numerous styling aspects. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Having this portfolio successfully deployed and consistently updated will allow me to pursue employment opportunities shortly after bootcamp completion.

## Acceptance Criteria:

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
